Notice two things in the command above.
One, we have added the --auto-terminate option to terminate the cluster after completing all the steps 
because EMR clusters are costly. However, you can ignore this option, and terminate the cluster manually after your job is done.
Two, we haven't specified the --bootstrap-actions option. This step is optional.
[Optional] Specify your bootstrap file - You should save an executable (bootstrap_emr.sh file) in an accessible S3 location.
You can specify this option as, for example, --bootstrap-actions Path=s3://mybucket/bootstrap_emr.sh in the command below.
A sample file is provided in the Github repo here.
